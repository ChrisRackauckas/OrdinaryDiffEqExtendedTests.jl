# OrdinaryDiffEqExtendedTests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisRackauckas/OrdinaryDiffEqExtendedTests.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisRackauckas/OrdinaryDiffEqExtendedTests.jl)

This repository is for extended tests of OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. They cover extra
features like full convergence tests of the Feagin methods and units compatibility
which take too long to be part of the standard test suite.
